This is a full sample for using writing E2E tests for Azure Functions, using xUnit.

A full write up can be found on my blog here: [E2E Testing Azure Functions](https://www.adathedev.co.uk/2022/01/e2e-testing-azure-functions.html)

### You will need:
* Azure Functions Core Tools installed
* Azure Storage Emulator/Azurite installed + running
* set the variables at the top of the AzureFunctionsFixture class in the AdaTheDev.AzureFunctionsE2ETests project, to the appropriate values for your local environment
